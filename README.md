# Valor

A top-down roguelike video game with an old school arcade style. The king and guard have left for vacation. They mistakenly forgot that their best warrior was patrolling the dungeon and locked the door behind them. The future doesn't look good.
You will most likely only survive for a day or two so you might as well take out as many baddies down there as you can and leave your name in histoy! Do you have the valor?
