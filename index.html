            <p>These demons spawn from lava fountains found on the walls of the dungeon. They will follow you no matter where you go!</p>

            <p>They look cute but these little guys are fast... and dangerous. They spawn on skull stacks and can only move horizontally.</p>

          <li>
            <img id="ghost" src="./src/images/ghostInfo.png">
            <p>These lost souls wander the halls found in the lower sections of the dungeon. They are slow, spawn randomly, and will only pursue you if you're in proximity.</p>
          </li>

            <img id="greenMonster" src="./src/images/greenInfo.png">
            <p>There's no time to snack in the dungeon's kitchen. These slimes will attack if you enter their culinary home but leave you be otherwise.</p>

            <img id="ogre" src="./src/images/ogreInfo.png">
            <p>Big boss man. He guards the treasurey and a vial of holy water that will temporary super power you!</p>

          The king and guard have left for vacation. They mistakenly forgot that their best warrior was patrolling the dungeon and locked the door behind them. The future doesn't look good.
          You will most likely only survive for a day or two so you might as well take out as many baddies down there as you can and leave your name in histoy! Do you have the valor?

      <div class="playInstructions">
        <p>It's very simple and straightforward to navigate the dungeon and slay monsters.</p>
        <ul> 
          <li>
            <p>Use the arrow keys to move in 4 directions.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Use the space bar to shoot arrows. Holding the space bar will auto shoot.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The "P" key will pause the game.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>There is no win mechanic(I DID say the future doesnt look good). Your goal is to slay as many monsters as possible before you meet your end.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>You only have one life so use it wisely!</p>
